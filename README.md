# Kotlin_Array_Example
Kotlin Array Basic Example
This is a minimal program for teaching purposes. It shows how to setup and use an array in the Kotlin language.
It declares an empty array that can hold four values, one value can be held in each of the four elements of the array.
A for loop is used to print the value of each location in the array, showing that it has no value and is therefore null.
The next for loop is used to read numbers into the array that the user enters using keyboard input.
Then another for loop is used to print the each of the values that the user has entered into the array.
